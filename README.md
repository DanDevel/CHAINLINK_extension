CHAINLINK Google Chrome Extension


Hi,

My project is a google chrome extension good for traders. (theres a video detailing the project inside the .rar file.)


You can use the eth price from the chainlink contract to use as a trustable price.
This way your team / coworkers can trust the price ayou are trading. nice!


It shows the eth price between other 3 exchanges and how much you can prift by trading among them.


Languages on this project:

html
JavaScript
python (web3.py)
solidity (chainlink contract - getLatestPrice function)

HOW to use:

1 - run flask aplication on VSCODE 
2 - instal extension
3 - click on extension icon ;)
